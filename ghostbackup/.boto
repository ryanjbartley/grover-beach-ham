[Boto]

# Set 'https_validate_certificates' to False to disable server certificate
# checking. The default for this option in the boto library is currently
# 'False' (to avoid breaking apps that depend on invalid certificates); it is
# therefore strongly recommended to always set this option explicitly to True
# in configuration files, to protect against "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
